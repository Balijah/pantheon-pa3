The most challenging part of this assignment was getting the experimental environment set up correctly, especially given the outdated tooling dependencies and system constraints. Pantheon requires Python 2.7, older Boost libraries, and Mahimahi utilities that don’t install cleanly on modern Linux distributions or ARM-based machines. This created a cascade of technical roadblocks, including failed builds, missing binaries, and configuration mismatches between the host and VM.  

Even after migrating to an Ubuntu 20.04 virtual machine, I encountered issues with Mahimahi’s networking stack (e.g., permission errors with network namespaces and `mm-tunnelserver` failures). These environment-related problems consumed the majority of my time and prevented me from actually running the congestion control algorithms—which was the core goal of the assignment.


Yes, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and DeepSeek were used throughout this assignment.

- Debugging: LLMs helped interpret unknown errors.
- Tool setup: I used an LLM to walk through steps for setting up Pantheon and Mahimahi on a VM, and to identify system packages that were missing or deprecated.
- Troubleshooting legacy software: Since the software stack is several years old, many online forums lacked current answers. LLMs could infer solutions or combine multiple threads of information quickly.

- I probably would have developed stronger low-level debugging skills, especially around Linux networking, system dependencies, and compilation errors if I had manually researched and tested each solution, but that would take too long.
- I might have become more fluent in reading CMake/makefile outputs and tracking down obscure package conflicts.

- Contextualizing legacy software: Instead of spending hours scouring GitHub issues and old forums, LLMs gave me concise explanations of why certain errors were happening.
- Efficiency: I could iterate faster by asking follow-up questions, rather than switching between tabs and trial-and-error Googling.

In short, LLMs didn’t remove the need for problem-solving—they helped narrow down the most likely causes and gave suggestions to try.

- Other students who were also working on Pantheon; we compared notes on VM configurations.
- TA, who provided guidance on which Ubuntu version might be more compatible and suggested using UTM
- I frequently consulted ChatGPT and DeepSeek as a virtual assistant to guide environment setup and troubleshoot bugs.
